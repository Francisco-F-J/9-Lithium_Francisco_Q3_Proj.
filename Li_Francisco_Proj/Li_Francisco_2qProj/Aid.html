		<h1>Enumerating problems with paper straws</h1>
		<p>One of the solutions that humanity came up with to reduce the amount of non-biodegradable disposable garbage getting littered every place on land and sea was a simple one: produce biodegradable alternatives of these disposable items to completely eliminate or at least reduce the presence of non-biodegradable materials in the environment. There are now biodegradable versions for many eating utensils like, paper plates, cups and the main topic of the website, paper straws.</p>
		<p>One of the problems that paper straws have is obvious: they're made of paper, and paper loses its structural integrity in contact with any liquid substance, the very thing that straws are supposed to be used on. Unlike paper cups that are coated inside with parafin wax or Polyethylene (which is sadly a plastic) and paper plates that have a lining of foil on the side in contact with food, paper straws don't have any form of lining or coating to protect its paper body from absorbing liquids, making them prone to absorbing liquids which make them gradually lose their structural integrity the longer they are in contact with liquid substances.</p>
		<p>Another problem with paper straws which is in conjunction with the issue previously mentioned: bits of paper ride with the upward flow of any liquid substance when someone sips on it which then gets ingested, causing several medical problems. (i.e.: Foreign Body Indigestion, suffocation, etc. ) When paper straws get wet, the body slowly expands and the hydrogen bonds that hold its fibers together get damaged, leaving the fibers vulnerable from breaking off of each other when applied with enough force to do so. </p>
		<p>To be fair, there are actually paper straws that do have water-resistant coating, which doesn't matter anyway since the materials used for the coating contain toxic chemicals that mix in with liquid substances at various temperatures.</p>
