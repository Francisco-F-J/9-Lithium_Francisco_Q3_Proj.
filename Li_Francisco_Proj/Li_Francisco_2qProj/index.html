		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			For a long time, humanity, or at least much of the human population, have been entertaining the idea of having a 
			"sustainable" way of life. We now are starting to think more about how our actions, practices and traditions like 
			deforestation and excessive production of greenhouse gases affect the environment and all living beings that reside 
			it. One example of this is the number of inventions that are capable of running on renewable sources of power which 
			is in response to the threats imposed by global warming and the fact that the sources of energy that we are currently 
			relying on (i.e.: crude oil, fossil fuels, etc.) are non-renewable and will take the planet millions of years to 
			produce a fraction of it back. This pushed humanity to advocate the use sustainable energy and limiting the use of 
			non-biodegradable materials such as plastic. These chain of events led to the inception of paper straws. Despite 
			the bright and simple idea behind it: to create a biodegradable alternative to plastic straws, its many flaws not 
			only make them infuriating to use; in fact, they are outright unusable.
		</p>
		<h1>The website's purpose</h1>
		<p>
			This website will be discussing the current problems of paper straws and several things that can be done to remove 
			its problems or at least improve some aspects of it.
