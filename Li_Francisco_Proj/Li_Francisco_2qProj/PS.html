		<h1>Proposed Solutions (or the lack thereof)</h1>
		<p>To be blunt, making life on Earth more sustainable is not just as easy as a simple swap of materials to be used for items that are to litter every nook and cranny of basically any place after a couple of uses. Most solutions implemented for biodegradable disposable items are either defeating the product's purpose like the foil layer on paper plates, or harmful to the human body just like the water-resistant coating on newer paper straws.</p>
		<p>It's not only these factors that should be thought about in this topic, the materials needed for production, the sources of energy used to power manufacturing plants and modes of shipping are things that also need thorough planning. Although paper is an optimal material for making biodegradable disposable items, it should also be noted that this material is made from wood which comes from trees, which means that constant deforestation is necessary to keep up with the rate of consumption. Also, the usual fuels used to power manufacturing plants and shipping vessels for these items cause high greenhouse gas emissions. The paper industry is considered globally to be the fifth-largest energy consumer.</p>
		<p>For an item to be environmentally sustainable, everything that goes into it should be sustainable. As it currently stands, humanity still has got a long way to go in terms of creating disposable items, specifically paper straws that are harmless, and environmentally sustainable. </p>
